      <description>Agent Agent has two functionalities:
 Perceive the environment through sensors (-&amp;gt;percepts). Act upon the environment through actuators (-&amp;gt;actions).  AI Solver The basic models and tasks include:
 Constraint Satisfaction/SAT: find state that satisfies constraints Planning Problems: find action sequence that produces desired state Planning with Feedback: find strategy for producing desired state  Classical Planning Model  Planning is the model-based approach to autonomous behavior A system can be in one of many states States assign values to a set of variables Actions change the values of certain variables Basic task: find action sequence to drive initial state into goal state  Search algorithms for planning exploit the correspondence between (classical) states model S(P) and directed graphs:</description>
