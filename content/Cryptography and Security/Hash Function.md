#### Hash Function

There will be three topics related to **HASH FUNCTION** in this article. Generally, **Hash Function** could be divided into two part, *Block cipher construct* and *dedicated hash function*. Our focus is on dedicated function, which contains three aspects.

1. MD4 Family
    1. MD5
    2. SHA-1
    3. SHA-3
2. SHA-3
3. Others

##### Properties of Hash Function

##### SHA-1

###### Overview

###### Internal Construction

###### SHA-1 Properties

###### Remaining Problem when implementing

***Insides of Rounds***



***Message Schedule***

##### SHA-3

Finally, there are two ref videos introducing the algorithms of Hash Function perfectly.
